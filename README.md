# StocksWebsite
Website using .NET Core MVC and the AlphaVantage API to provide up to date stock/crypto information for the user.

<b>Additions I would like to make in the future:</b>
- Move away from text file based structure for backend (so it can actually be deployed)
- Clean up CSS 
- Clean up/Make service functions generic
- Ensure views work correctly on devices with different screen sizes
- Allow the user to change the time frame while looking at stock/crypto data
