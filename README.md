# StocksWebsite
Website using .NET Core MVC and the AlphaVantage API to provide up to date stock/crypto information for the user.

Additions I would like to make in the future:
- Move away from text file based structure for backend (so it can actually be deployed)
- Clean up CSS 
- Clean up/Make service functions generic
- Allow the user to change the time frame while looking at stock/crypto data


(Project currently includes AlphaVantage API key...please get your own key through the AlphaVantage website)
